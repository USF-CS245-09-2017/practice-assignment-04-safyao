Comments:
I followed Professor Brizan's requirements for this assignment. Hopefully my comments explain the code well enough.
I was really surprised (and a little annoyed) at how slow Bubble Sort went, but it makes sense since it requires multiple iterations through the array. The assignment really showed how simple is better--since Insertion Sort was the fastest all-around.
